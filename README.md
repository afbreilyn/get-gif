# GetGif
this is a simple demo app that uses the GIPHY api for all sorts of fun times

set up: 
- you'll need a secret key from giphy! put is in `secret.js` in the src folder

to run:
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

##### N.B.
- sorry for the lack of 'pretty-ness', just wanted to get it done. maybe later....
- and of course i pronounced it GIF ;)
